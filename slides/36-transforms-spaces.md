## Transforms: Theory 

The secret of graphics is *transforming* data from one space to another.

There are several spaces that are relevant in graphics:

* **Object space**: the coordinate system of mesh positiosn
* **World space**: the coordinate system shared by all meshes and cameras
* **Camera space**: the coordinate system of the camera
* **NDC space**: the coordinate system of a view frustum
* **Screen space**: the coordinate system of the framebuffer
