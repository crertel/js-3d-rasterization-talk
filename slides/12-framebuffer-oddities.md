## Framebuffer: Oddities

Some weird behaviors exist. What happens if a framebuffer...
* ...is changed before the screen is finished drawing? {_class="fragment"}
* ...only uses 16 bits per pixel? {. class="fragment"}
* ...is stored in the wrong order? {. class="fragment"}
* ...is stored in faulty memory? {. class="fragment"}
