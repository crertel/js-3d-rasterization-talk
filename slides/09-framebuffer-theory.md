## Framebuffer: Theory of operation

* We have a region of bytes in memory
* The CPU sets the values in this region
* Separate from CPU, graphics card scans region
* DACs (digital-to-analog converters) convert bytes into color signals
* Color signals modulate beam as it scans monitor in raster pattern.
