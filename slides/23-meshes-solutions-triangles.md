## Meshes: Solution -- Triangles

We take an object and cover its surface in triangles. We get back a collection of `$(X,Y,Z,U,V)$` 3-tuples (triangles).

* **Pros**: simple to render, straightforward to generate, handy math properties
* **Cons**: potentially large files, limited resolution, tricks only through over tesselation
