## Meshes: Wavefront OBJ 1/3

We'll use a simple triangle format from the 90s: Wavefront OBJ.

OBJs are:

* line-delimited format
* support texture coordinates
* support normals and smoothing groups
* support indexed primitives
* support multiple objects
* support comments

We'll be implementing a subset of these.
